# Reconstruction project for territory near Erebuni museum

## Why?
The territory is designed poorly, with unnecessary asphalt fields that collect dust, make very hot summers even hotter, and make pedestrians' lives uncomfortable. This proposal is meant to show how much better it could be with little change.
